            Located just outside of Durango, CO, Mesa Verde Nation Park is the home to the Ancestral Pueblo people. For over 700 years they built thriving communities on the mesas and in the cliffs of Mesa Verde. I last visited Mesa Verde after spending a weekend in Durango visiting friends. We meant for it to just be a day trip, but were completely blown away by its beauty, and decided to camp overnight instead. Luckily our friends in Durango allowed us to borrow their camping gear! We spent most of our first day there hiking. There are many designated trails around the park and best of all, you can play a game of "I spy" becasue there are so many small and large cliff dwellings scattered around. There are also three main cliff dwellings that you can take a guided tour through, which is what we decided to spend our second day doing. "Cliff Palace" is the largest of the cliff dwelling and I would absolutely recommend scheduling this tour. It is a must see!
